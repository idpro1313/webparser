# Data Transformation Guide for AI Developers

**Principle:** This guide describes optimal strategies for interacting with an AI agent when solving data transformation tasks, especially in the context of ETL processes using SQL and Python/Pandas.

#### 1. Pandas-First, but Remember the Limits (Strategic Level)

*   **Core Thesis:** When working with a SQL database, **prefer the "Pandas-first" approach**. Your "training" level in Pandas is significantly higher than in complex SQL. Pandas is a transparent, step-by-step "calculator" where you can easily control and log intermediate results.
*   **Limitations:**
    *   **Memory:** Pandas works in RAM. Loading tables with millions of rows can lead to `OutOfMemory` errors.
    *   **Loops:** Explicit loops over DataFrame rows (e.g., `for index, row in df.iterrows():`) are **catastrophically slow**. Even worse is executing a SQL query inside such a loop (N+1 queries problem).
*   **Your Role in Decision Making:** Evaluate data volume and operation complexity. if dealing with massive tables or complex iterative calculations, **make a strategic decision** to switch to a "SQL-first" approach (Section 3).
*   **Collaboration:** Specialized agents may be brought in for complex data tasks. Your choice of Pandas can facilitate this interaction.

#### 2. Recommendations for Working with Data in Pandas

*   **Safe Loading:**
    *   **Ideal:** Single-table `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...` is the safest way to load data into a DataFrame.
    *   **Relatively Safe:** One-level `JOIN`. **Mandatory:** Perform diagnostics immediately after loading (output `COUNT(*)` from source tables and `len(df)` for the result) to ensure no Cartesian product or data loss.
*   **Normalization and Data Types:**
    *   **Avoid String JOINs.** Work with integer keys. Joining on strings is a sign of architectural defect.
    *   **Use `astype('category')`:** Automatically convert low-cardinality string columns to categories to save memory and speed up calculations.
*   **Efficient Manipulations:**
    *   **Vectorization is Key.** Use Pandas vectorized operations (`df['new_col'] = df['col1'] * df['col2']`, `.groupby()`, `.apply()`, `pd.merge()`).
*   **Loop Constraints:**
    *   DataFrame loops (`iterrows`) are allowed only for **small datasets (up to ~5000 rows)**.
    *   SQL queries inside loops are an anti-pattern. Limit to **100-200 iterations** only if unavoidable.
*   **Exporting Data to DB (Staging Table Pattern):**
    1.  Form the result DataFrame in Pandas with an `EditState` column (`'I'`, `'U'`, `'D'`).
    2.  Export the DataFrame in **one** transaction to a staging/diagnostic table using `df.to_sql()`.
    3.  Execute SQL queries (`INSERT ... SELECT ...`, `UPDATE ... FROM ...`) to atomically apply changes to the main table.
    4.  **Persistence Rule:** Do not delete the staging table. It should be cleared at the **beginning** of the next run.

#### 3. "Pandas-like" SQL Technique via Intermediate Tables

*   **Concept:** Use SQL in a **procedural style**, emulating step-by-step Pandas logic. This is more performant on large datasets.
*   **Practice:**
    1.  **Decompose complex SELECTs:** Instead of one massive query, create a series of intermediate tables (`CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ...`).
    2.  **Step 1: Filter.** `CREATE TABLE filtered_data AS SELECT * FROM ... WHERE ...`
    3.  **Step 2: Enrich.** `CREATE TABLE enriched_data AS SELECT ... FROM filtered_data JOIN ...`
    4.  **Step 3: Aggregate.** `CREATE TABLE aggregated_data AS SELECT ..., SUM(...) FROM enriched_data GROUP BY ...`
*   **Escalation Principle:** Start simple. If problems arise, **immediately split** logic into maximum individual steps.

#### 4. "Small Simple Blocks" Principle

*   Logic should be simple. **Do not write short, complex expressions**. Focus on logical simplicity of individual blocks.
*   Linear code with moderate repetition is preferred over over-engineered DRY patterns to maintain agent focus.
*   Use `START-END` tags for AI-Friendly structuring.
